Welcome to the 👛multisig cohort of the SpeedRunEthereum.com challenges!

You know how to build a basic dapp with a smart contract, you’ve tackled the DEX…

This ⛳️ challenge is to create your own multisig and deploy it to a live network with a frontend. 

You have two choices for starting repos:

JavaScript version: https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-challenges/tree/challenge-5-multi-sig

TypeScript version: https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-typescript-challenges/tree/challenge-5-multisig

⚽️ GOALS 🥅

 [ ] Can you edit and deploy the contract with a 2/3 multisig with two of your addresses and the buidlguidl multisig as the third signer? (buidlguidl.eth is like your backup recovery.) 

 [ ] Can you propose basic transactions with the frontend that sends them to the backend?

 [ ] Can you “vote” on the transaction as other signers? 

 [ ] Can you execute the transaction and does it do the right thing?

 [ ] Can you add and remove signers with a custom dialog (that just sends you to the create transaction dialog with the correct calldata)

 [ ] BONUS: for contributing back to the challenges and making components out of these UI elements that can go back to master or be forked to make a formal challenge

[ ] BONUS: multisig as a service! Create a deploy button with a copy paste dialog for sharing so _anyone_ can make a multisig at your url with your frontend

🧪 This build will require a good knowledge of signed messages and you can get a refresher here: https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-examples/tree/signature-recover

👉 Post your Multisig build to your profile on 🏤 (https://bazaar.buidlguidl.com/) BuidlGuidl.com

🧫 This build also doubles as a DAO starter kit and it will teach you how to better protect your own funds!

💬 Further clarifications for future folks who’ll drop in later: Autograder and other SE challenges related components goes to the Scafold-eth-challenges branch, the meta-multi-sig is there to inspire a functionning build as it serves as an example
